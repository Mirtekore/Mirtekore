# 2024 Projects

## Application fast track (CISSA SummerHack)

### Project Background
We built a web application called Application Fast Track which is used by companies to review resumes sent by applicants. The application aims to not hinder the work process of the recruiter while also helping applicants with their job search journey to lead them to less confusion in writing their resumes.
