# 2024 Projects

## 1. Application fast track (CISSA SummerHack)

### Project Overview
We built a web application called Application Fast Track which is used by companies to review resumes sent by applicants. The application aims to not hinder the work process of the recruiter while also helping applicants with their job search journey to lead them to less confusion in writing their resumes.

# 2023 Projects

## 1. Farmbots for Digital Agriculture

### Project Overview
One issue with farming machines are the specialized sensors used for detecting plant activities; the cost of such sensors are prohibitively high. The e-nose is the solution built in-house by the University of Melbourne's Electrical Engineering and Agricultural schools with the aim of increasing the accessibility of Farmbot robots. The e-nose is a low-cost sensor equipped with 9 chemical sensors to detect various particles passing through it as electrical signals.

Previous teams had integrated the e-nose with the Farmbot machine, generating readings in the form of time-series voltages ready for downstream analysis. We will continue with their efforts by making use of the time-series data to train the e-nose to use simple machine learning techniques to predict factors like pests and photosynthesis levels.
