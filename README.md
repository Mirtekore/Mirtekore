# 2024 Projects

## 1. Application fast track

### Project Overview
We built a web application called Application Fast Track which is used by companies to review resumes sent by applicants. The application aims to not hinder the work process of the recruiter while also helping applicants with their job search journey to lead them to less confusion in writing their resumes.

Technology used: Next.js, Tailwind, PostgreSQL

# 2023 Projects

## 1. Farmbots for Digital Agriculture

### Project Overview
One issue with farming machines are the specialized sensors used for detecting plant activities which have high costs. The e-nose is a low-cost chemical sensor built in-house by the University of Melbourne's Electrical Engineering and Agricultural schools with the aim of increasing the accessibility of Farmbot robots

Previous teams had integrated the e-nose with the Farmbot machine, generating readings in the form of time-series voltages ready for downstream analysis. We will continue with their efforts by making use of the time-series data to train the e-nose to use simple machine learning techniques to predict factors like pests and photosynthesis levels.

Technology used: Go, InfluxDB, Python


## 2. Sustainability pledge app

### Project Overview
This was our team's solution to bridge the gap between sustainability and technology. People can use the app to scan recyclable items and pledge to recycle them, thus reducing their carbon footprint. The goal of the app is to collectively fight back against high carbon emission activities (looking at you, XX's private jet flights). Investors who are environmentally conscious can also collab and set up sustainability events through our apps.

Technology used: React, Google Firebase


## 3. Azul

### Project overview
We experimented with different AI techniques to develop an autonomous agent team to play the board game Azul and compete in a tournament against other AI Azul players. The AI techniques we used were Greedy Best-First Search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-learning with Linear Approximation.

## 4. AI Twitter sentiment analysis

### Project overview
We created a cloud project on the UniMelb Research Cloud, it utilizes Twitter data exported from the Australian Data Observatory, public toots harvested from Australia's Mastodon server and geographic data about education and income level from the Spatial Urban Data Observatory. We use this information to ask the question: "What is Australia's general sentiment towards AI"

## 5. Totally-Looks-Like challenge


Technology used: Python

## 6. Supply and Demand modelling 

### Project overview

In this project, we explore the question of “How do consumer buying habits and producer selling strategies influence the price of a product in a competitive market?”. We will use agent-based models (ABM) to allow each buyer and seller to act in a way that maximizes their own goals and analyze the collective impact of buyers and sellers towards each other and the market as a whole.

Technology used: NetLogo


## 7. RMI Whiteboard


Technology used: Java

# 2022 projects

## Oh Heaven


Technology used: Java, UML

## Twitter sentiment analysis


Technology used: Python




TODO:
- Add a eye catching thumbnail to each project (maybe)
- Expand on projects to include feedback, improvements, and reflections
- Include the tools used to make the magic happen
- Upload uni notes for each subject
